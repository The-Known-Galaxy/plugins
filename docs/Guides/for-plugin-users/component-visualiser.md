# Component Visualiser
Made for doing what it says on the tin - visualisation of Components!
Although it is possible to somewhat trivially add more Component visualisations in the future, the current version (v0.4.0) supports `NamedArea`s, since it was written during Dawn Temple feature integration.

## NamedArea Visualisation
Locks/unlocks, hides/shows `WorldRegion`s with `NamedArea` tags a bright red colour to make it easier to work with setting up the zones.
Simply click the button each time you want to toggle the visualisation.

By default, when you log into a Studio, it'll **hide** all the visualisations.

:::tip
You can key-bind the toggle (to something useful like `ALT+V`) using the Studio Shortcut manager!
Very easy to toggle visualisations on/off on the fly.
